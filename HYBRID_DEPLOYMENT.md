### **Upload to Railway:**

   - Create new repository: `chat2chat-web`
   - Upload your `squish-call-hub` folder by dragging it to browser
4. **Select your repository** 
5. **IMPORTANT: Choose "Deploy from subdirectory"**: `signaling-server`
6. **Click "Deploy"**

### **Configure Railway:**
1. **Go to your Railway dashboard**
2. **Click your deployed service**
3. **Go to "Variables" tab**, add:
   ```
